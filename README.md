# sms_spam_detector

This challenge re-engineers code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. A Gradio app hosts the application, enabling users to test text messages. The app is created with three parameters for the “function”, “outputs”, and “inputs”. The “outputs” parameter is a textbox that contains a label to let the user know what to type in the box. The “inputs” parameter is a textbox that contains a label to let the user know that the prediction will be displayed in the textbox.
The Interface application can be accessed through the jupyter notebook or with the public URL [http://127.0.0.1:7861](https://b798be224b083b4dba.gradio.live). 

This challenge was completed independently as well as with support from an EdX tutor.
